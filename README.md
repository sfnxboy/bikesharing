For this project, we'll use data from the Citi Bike program in New York City. This data includes a variety of fields, which we'll get to shortly. The data you'll download will be contained in a flat file, a CSV. Go to the Citi Bike System Data page (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). In the "Citi Bike Trip Histories" section, click the link that say "downloadable diles for Citi Bike trip data."
